<h2>
    The story
</h2> 
<p class="font">
<p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</p><p><q class="QuoteDialogueV">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q></p><p> The farmer said,</p> <p><q class="QuoteDialogueF"><em>Maybe.</em> </q></p><p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> <p><q class="QuoteDialogueV">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q></p><p> The farmer again said,</p><p><q class="QuoteDialogueF"><strong>Maybe.</strong> </q></p>

<p> The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p><p> <q class="QuoteDialogueV">"Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag>”</q> </p><p> and the farmer responded,</p><q class="QuoteDialogueF"><em> Maybe. </em></q></p><p> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> <p><q class="QuoteDialogueV">“Isn’t that great!”</q> </p>Again, he said,<p><q class="QuoteDialogueF"><strong>Maybe.</strong> </q></p>

<blockquote class="Quote">
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag attribute="good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good">good</tag> fortune.

<p>Good and <tag class="bad">Bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are <tag class="good">good</tag> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <tag class="good">good</tag> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
